## 1. Intro
HTML5 works hand in hand with CSS3 to create websites that we use every day. In fact, the website you are currently viewing this content on is built with HTML and CSS.

In this project, using my HTML and CSS knowledge, I performed the cloning of the Google interface.

## 2. What I built
In this project, I focused on building the cloning of the Google interface.
It contains the following sections:

* Header: a section that involves the profile picture, icons, and the menu with hyperlinks.
* Main: a container section for the central elements of the page: logo, search bar, icons, and buttons.
* Footer: a section that includes hyperlinks at the bottom of the page.

## 3. Project goal
The objective of the project is to learn to use HTML5 and CSS3 tags.
